    "## Game Components\n",
    "- **Board**:\n",
    "  - 40 spaces:\n",
    "    - 22 properties (grouped by colors, 2-3 per group).\n",
    "    - 4 railroads.\n",
    "    - 2 utilities (Electric Company, Water Works).\n",
    "    - 6 special spaces: *Chance* (3), *Community Chest* (3).\n",
    "    - 2 tax spaces (*Luxury Tax*, *Income Tax*).\n",
    "    - Start, Jail, *Go to Jail*, and Free Parking.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cards**:\n",
    "  - 16 *Chance* cards.\n",
    "  - 16 *Community Chest* cards.\n",
    "  - Title deeds for all properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Money**:\n",
    "  - Total of $20,580 in various denominations ($1 to $500).  \n",
    "    - 1 $: 30\n",
    "    - 5 $: 30\n",
    "    - 10 $: 30\n",

    "    - 500 $: 30\n",
    "   \n",
    "- **Tokens**:\n",
    "  - Up to 8 player tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Buildings**:\n",
    "  - 32 houses, 12 hotels.\n",
    "  - We will consider to have an ininite amount of houses and hotels\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Rules\n",
    "- **Turn Mechanics**:\n",
    "  - Roll two six-sided dice; move forward the sum of the dice.\n",
    "  - Rolling doubles grants an extra turn; rolling doubles 3 times sends the player to Jail.\n",
    "  - Perform actions based on the space landed on.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Special Spaces**:\n",
    "  - *Go*: Collect $200 when passing.\n",
    "  - *Jail*: Stay up to 3 turns unless paying $50 or using a “Get Out of Jail Free” card.\n",
    "  - *Go to Jail*: Move directly to Jail.\n",
    "  - *Free Parking*: No action.\n",
    "  - We will consider *Go to Jail* a normal location, because it doesn't effect the game in long terms\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Properties**:\n",
    "  - Buy unowned properties; pay rent if owned.\n",
    "  - Rent increases with buildings (houses/hotels).\n",
    "  - Must own all properties of a color group to build.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cards**:\n",
    "  - *Chance* and *Community Chest* cards can move players, alter funds, or send to Jail.\n",
    "  - *Move directly to START* card doesn't work. It's basically uninfluential on the results\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Objective**:\n",
    "  - Bankrupt all opponents.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Monte Carlo Simulation\n",
    "- **Simulation Focus**:\n",
    "  - Landing probabilities for each space.\n",
    "  - Cost-benefit analysis of properties.\n",
    "  - Construction efficiency (houses/hotels).\n",
    "  - Return on Investment (ROI) by property group.\n",

    "- **Key Parameters**:\n",
    "  - Visit probabilities, state transitions, and profitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example Iteration**:\n",
